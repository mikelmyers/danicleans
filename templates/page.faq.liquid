              <summary>What's included in a recurring cleaning?</summary>
              <p>Our recurring cleaning covers all main living areas: vacuuming, mopping, dusting, kitchen counters and appliances (exterior), bathroom sanitizing, trash removal, and general tidying. We follow a detailed checklist every visit so nothing gets missed.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What's the difference between a deep clean and a recurring clean?</summary>
              <p>A deep clean is a thorough top-to-bottom scrub — inside cabinets, behind appliances, baseboards, light fixtures, window sills, and more. We recommend a deep clean as your first visit, then switch to recurring maintenance cleanings to keep everything fresh.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Do I need to be home during the cleaning?</summary>
              <p>Nope! Many of our clients give us a key, a lockbox code, or a garage code. We'll lock up when we leave and you'll come home to a spotless house. We're fully insured so your home is always protected.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What if I need to reschedule?</summary>
              <p>Life happens — just give us 24 hours' notice and we'll happily reschedule at no charge. Same-day cancellations may be subject to a fee since we've reserved the time for your home.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Do you bring your own supplies and equipment?</summary>
              <p>Yes, we bring everything — vacuums, mops, cleaning solutions, and all supplies. We use eco-friendly products by default, but if you have a preferred product you'd like us to use, just let us know.</p>

          <h3>Landscaping & Lawn Care</h3>
          <div class="faq-cat-list">
            <details>
              <summary>How often should I have my lawn mowed?</summary>
              <p>During growing season (April through October), we recommend weekly or bi-weekly mowing. We'll adjust the schedule based on your lawn's growth rate, grass type, and the season. Winter mowing is rarely needed in our area.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Do you handle leaf removal and seasonal cleanup?</summary>
              <p>Absolutely. Our seasonal cleanup includes leaf blowing and removal, bed cleanup, debris clearing, gutter clearing, and prepping your yard for the next season. Most clients book spring and fall cleanups.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Can you help with landscaping design and planting?</summary>
              <p>Yes! We offer landscape design consultations, mulching, bed edging, shrub and tree planting, flower bed installation, and hardscape work. We'll work with you to create a plan that fits your style and budget.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What's included in your lawn maintenance package?</summary>
              <p>Our lawn maintenance includes mowing, edging, trimming, and blowing all walkways and driveways clean. Add-ons like fertilization, aeration, and weed control are available at an additional cost.</p>

          <h3>Pricing & Booking</h3>
          <div class="faq-cat-list">
            <details>
              <summary>How is pricing determined?</summary>
              <p>Pricing depends on your home size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, service frequency, and any add-ons you select. Our online quote calculator gives you an instant estimate, or we can provide a custom quote after learning about your specific needs.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Do you offer bundle discounts?</summary>
              <p>Yes — bundle cleaning and landscaping services together and save 10%. It's the easiest way to keep your whole property looking great with one company and one bill.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What payment methods do you accept?</summary>
              <p>We accept credit/debit cards, Venmo, Zelle, and checks. For recurring clients, we can set up automatic billing so you never have to think about it.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Is there a minimum service charge?</summary>
              <p>Our minimum for cleaning services starts at $100, and lawn mowing starts at $40. Exact pricing depends on your property size and the services requested.</p>

            <details>
